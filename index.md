I am a physicochemist with a specialization in numerical simulations of electrochemical equilibria at solid/solid and solid/liquid interfaces. I work on theoretical models and computational techniques that shall help bridge the gaps from atomistic to mesoscopic and macroscopic length scales. In this way, my research contributes to the development of electrochemical processes in energy storage devices like supercapacitors and batteries.

Since 2025, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) in &Aring;s, Norway.
