### Grain-boundary space-charge layers in ion-conducting solids
The electrical resistance of ion-conducting oxides (useful e.g. as solid electrolytes in fuel cells) is often largely determined by the grain-to-grain contacts. The resistance of pristine grain boundaries in ion-conducting solids is generally attributed to the presence
of space charge at the grain boundaries&mdash;specifically, the mobile majority charge carriers are depleted in the space-charge layers, owing to an excess charge of the grain-boundary core, by which they are repelled.

In the simplest case, the counter-charged ions (e.g., acceptor cations) are assumed to take a uniform concentration profile throughout the sample (Mott&ndash;Schottky model). In the scope of this oversimplified representation, closed-form expressions may be derived that relate the electrical properties (resistance, capacitance) of grain boundaries to the space-charge potential &Phi;<sub>0</sub>, i.e., the value of the electric potential at the edge between grain-boundary core and space-charge layer, relative to the bulk reference value.

In my research, I have studied by means of continuum (FEM) simulations how electrical properties are related to &Phi;<sub>0</sub> in more complex cases, taking into account the typical thermal history of ceramic samples. Upon sintering, acceptor cations will be mobile and reach electrochemical equilibrium. When the sample is subsequently cooled down, the cations' mobility decreases. At typical measurement conditions (500&ndash;1000 K), the cations may typically be considered to be immobile, with their concentration profile being retained from a high-temperature equilibrium state. This scenarios may be modelled in the scope of the restricted-equilibrium model, in which the cation profile is assumed to be frozen-in abruptly at a transition temperature.
